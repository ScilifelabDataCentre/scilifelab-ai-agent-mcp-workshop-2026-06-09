# SciLifeLab Workshop: LangGraph AI Agents for Drug Discovery

---

A comprehensive hands-on workshop tutoring participants how to build AI agents using LangGraph, specifically focused on drug discovery applications.

## Workshop Overview

This 75-minute interactive workshop introduces participants to **LangGraph**, a low-level orchestration framework for constructing stateful AI workflows using graphs. Participants will learn to build AI agents that can perform mathematical calculations, search scientific literature, and query drug databases.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Understand core concepts of LangGraph (tools, nodes, edges, state, and memory)
- Create and integrate custom tools for AI agents
- Build a ReAct-style agent from scratch using LLMs and custom tools
- Implement agent memory to maintain conversational context
- Compare custom agents with prebuilt LangGraph agents
- Explore advanced features like error handling and streaming

## Getting Started

**Change directory to Section 1**

```bash
cd Section_1_LangGraph
```

**Build Docker Image**

```bash
docker build -t scilifelab-langgraph-jupyter .
```

**Run Docker container**

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 scilifelab-langgraph-jupyter
```


**Access and practice**

Make sure to provide the API key if it is not done before,

```bash
# replace `sk-...` with your OpenAI API key
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."' > .env
```

Go to localhost:8888 on your browser and starting the lab
