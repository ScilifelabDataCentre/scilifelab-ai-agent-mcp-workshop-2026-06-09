# SciLifeLab Workshop: LangGraph AI Agents for Drug Discovery

---

A comprehensive hands-on workshop tutoring participants how to build AI agents using LangGraph, specifically focused on drug discovery applications.

## Workshop Overview

This 75-minute interactive workshop introduces participants to **LangGraph**, an orchestration framework for bulding stateful AI agents/workflows/systems using graphs. Participants will learn to build AI agents that can perform literature search, resolving SMILES string, and calculating physiochemical properties.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

- Understand core concepts of LangGraph (tools, nodes, edges, state, and memory)
- Create and integrate custom tools for AI agents
- Build a ReAct-style agent from scratch using LLMs and custom tools
- Implement agent memory to maintain conversational context
- Compare custom agents with prebuilt LangGraph agents
- Explore advanced agentic architectures, including  CodeAct agent and Multi-agent.

## Getting Started

**Change directory to Section 1**

```bash
cd Section_1_LangGraph
```

**Build Docker Image**

```bash
docker build -t scilifelab-langgraph-jupyter:v1 .
```

**Run Docker container**

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 \
  -e PILOT_API_KEY="sk-..." \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." \
  scilifelab-langgraph-jupyter:v1
```

The notebooks use the **SciLifeLab pilot LLM service** by default (`PILOT_API_KEY`)
and fall back to **OpenAI** (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) if the pilot service is unreachable.
If `PILOT_API_KEY` is not supplied, the workshop's shared pilot key is used.

Go to **http://localhost:8888** on your browser and starting the lab
